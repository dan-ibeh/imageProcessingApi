# Image Processing Api Project

This project was done as a requirement for the completion of the Udacity FullStack JavaScript Nanodegree program.
This project aims to give a real-world scenario in which reading and writing is to a disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. The project serves two purposes: to set up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

http://localhost:3000/image?filename={filename}&width={width}&height={height}

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly compiles TypeScript in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
